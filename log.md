# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Javascript's if-else, logical operator and comparasion.

**Thoughts:** Comparasion can sometime be confused if null and undefined take in. The next thing is multiple conditional operator. It's pretty confusing but still fine compared
to comparasion with null and undefined. Logical Operator in the other hand also have the same difficulties when multiple logical condition take in. Well, i still need to train
about those so i can get used to it.

### Day 1: February 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Javascript's null coelascing, loops like: while, for, do while, switch-case.

**Thoughts:** Labels is intresting. This is my first time encounter someting like labels in loops. Need to practice more about labels. Cause, i still have a limited vision of
the usage of label.

### Day 2: Febuary 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about function: callbacks, expression vs declaration, arrow function in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Function expression is an awesome feature. Need to find a suitable use case for that later.

### Day 3: Febuary 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about DevTools debugger, suggested javascript code style, comments placement, mocha test, bdd style of writing test,
explored about polyfills and transpilers.

**Thoughts:** Writting test can really hope development an app faster. But writing a test can also be a pain.

### Day 4: Febuary 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about basic objects and it's ordering system, object's copying reference, object assign, garbage collection, this keyword.

**Thoughts:** `this` keyword boundary is so confusing.

### Day 5: Febuary 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about constructor, optional chaining (null safe), symbol

**Thoughts:** I still haven't figured yet when to use constructor function outside of the class. I actually in the middle of understanding object conversion. But, i still blank
right now. I gotta figure it out tomorrow.

### Day 6: Febuary 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about object conversion, Primitive Methods, Numbers methods

**Thoughts:** After a fresh start and mind. Object conversion are finally make sense for me.

### Day 7: March 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about string methods: like codepoint, substring, finding an index, accessing a specific char, Learned about array and some of it methods like:
push/pop, shift/unshift, and arrays specific looping.

**Thoughts:** It's been one week. Pretty tough week, but i'll do my best. It's pretty weird everytime you need to make a new array like doing push. You can't do something like
`array[] = values`. But you need to define the length `array[array.length] = values`.

### Day 8: March 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about more most used arrays object, iterator, and how to manually use iterator or explicitly call it

**Thoughts:** Array methods is a lot. At this far i still barely understand about how to use `reduce()`.

### Day 9: March 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about map datatype, set datatype, Object entity and fromEntity, weakMap datatype, weakSet datatype and their usage, `Object.keys(obj)` to get a
key, `Object.values(obj)` to get a values, and `Object.entries(obj)` to get an entries.

**Thoughts:** I was suprised since i never met this kinds of data types before... It can come in handy.

### Day 10: March 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about array, object, nested destruction, and learned about smart function parameters, learned about date, and use case methods usage to increase
performance

**Thoughts:** I somehow need to very careful when it comes to choosing date method. Since it can impact performance...

### Day 11: March 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JSON, methods stringify and it's arguments, methods parse and it's arguments, function recursion.

**Thoughts:** It's really important to decide which loop to use. Since function recursion could be heavy if we not analyzed the flow first or optimized the code.

### Day 12: March 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about rest parameters, scope and closure, lexical environment, V8 Garbage Collection side effect in debugger.

### Day 13: March 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about var, global object, function object, NFE.

### Day 14: March 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about `new` function syntax, set timeout and interval, Scheduling with setTimeout & setInterval, nested timeout & zero delay, NodeJS specific
immediate call.

### Day 15: March 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about decorators and forwarding, call and apply

**Thoughts:**: Right now i only understand a little about decorators and forwading. Need to see another references tommorow.

### Day 16: March 10, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Manage to learned more about decorators and forwading, learned about function bindings, revisit arrow function to learn about lexical `this` and
`arguments`.

### Day 17: March 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about property descriptors/flags of object properties: define and getOwnProperty, Property Accessor: Getter and setter

### Day 18: March 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about prototypal, and function prototype. `__proto__`, `prototype`, and Object's prototype.

### Day 19: March 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Native Prototype and Prototype Object Methods.

### Day 20: March 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about class: Getter & Setter, Constructor, Computed names, class fields, expressio, and syntax. Learned about Class Inheritance: extends, super,
method overriding, constructor overriding.

**Thoughts**: Still need to pay attention while overriding constructor.

### Day 21: March 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about visibility: Term of "_", private, read-only. Learned about static method or properties, extending built-in class like Array, etc. Learned 
about instanceOf, Object Prototype toString, Class Mixing.

### Day 22: March 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Try Catch and Finally, Throw, Global Catch, and Custom Error.
