# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Javascript's if-else, logical operator and comparasion.

**Thoughts:** Comparasion can sometime be confused if null and undefined take in. The next thing is multiple conditional operator. It's pretty confusing but still fine compared
to comparasion with null and undefined. Logical Operator in the other hand also have the same difficulties when multiple logical condition take in. Well, i still need to train
about those so i can get used to it.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
