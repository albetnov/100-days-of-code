# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Javascript's if-else, logical operator and comparasion.

**Thoughts:** Comparasion can sometime be confused if null and undefined take in. The next thing is multiple conditional operator. It's pretty confusing but still fine compared
to comparasion with null and undefined. Logical Operator in the other hand also have the same difficulties when multiple logical condition take in. Well, i still need to train
about those so i can get used to it.

### Day 1: February 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Javascript's null coelascing, loops like: while, for, do while, switch-case.

**Thoughts:** Labels is intresting. This is my first time encounter someting like labels in loops. Need to practice more about labels. Cause, i still have a limited vision of
the usage of label.

### Day 2: Febuary 24, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about function: callbacks, expression vs declaration, arrow function in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Function expression is an awesome feature. Need to find a suitable use case for that later.

### Day 3: Febuary 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about DevTools debugger, suggested javascript code style, comments placement, mocha test, bdd style of writing test,
explored about polyfills and transpilers.

**Thoughts:** Writting test can really hope development an app faster. But writing a test can also be a pain.

### Day 4: Febuary 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about basic objects and it's ordering system, object's copying reference, object assign, garbage collection, this keyword.

**Thoughts:** `this` keyword boundary is so confusing.

### Day 5: Febuary 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about constructor, optional chaining (null safe), symbol

**Thoughts:** I still haven't figured yet when to use constructor function outside of the class. I actually in the middle of understanding object conversion. But, i still blank
right now. I gotta figure it out tomorrow.

### Day 6: Febuary 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about object conversion, Primitive Methods, Numbers methods

**Thoughts:** After a fresh start and mind. Object conversion are finally make sense for me.

### Day 7: March 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learned about string methods: like codepoint, substring, finding an index, accessing a specific char, Learned about array and some of it methods like:
push/pop, shift/unshift, and arrays specific looping.

**Thoughts:** It's been one week. Pretty tough week, but i'll do my best. It's pretty weird everytime you need to make a new array like doing push. You can't do something like
`array[] = values`. But you need to define the length `array[array.length] = values`.
